I imagine most are aware of the difference, but just wanted to inform any newbies who may buy into a SPAC at a premium based on these internet rumors believing they are valid.

Also, it was a good chance to point out why I don't use the word "rumor" in my lists. retweets:: 0 replies:: 1

Now, whether these "talks" are advanced or not is a different story. As we all know, with the proliferation of SPACs, you would be hard-pressed to find a halfway-decent company that has NOT been in some level of "talks" with a SPAC (or ten) at some point. retweets:: 0 replies:: 1

However, the "In Talks" parties are or have been in talks, not speculation... likely leaked by the SPAC, the merger target, or other parties involved in the deal, in order to drum up awareness. retweets:: 0 replies:: 1

A SPAC reported as "In Talks" by Bloomberg is much different than a Reddit post speculating that $QELL will merge w/ Proterra due to a Director also being a Proterra Director (don't get me wrong, the speculation on which company a SPAC will merge with is fun). retweets:: 1 replies:: 1

Agree w/ @SpacGuru - and it's very important to make the distinction between an Internet rumor and a rumor from a prominent news source... That's why on the SPAC Track site and whenever I post about SPACs on Twitter that have been reported on as "in talks" retweets:: 0 replies:: 2
